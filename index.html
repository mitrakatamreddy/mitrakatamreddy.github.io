  "body": "Hi, I've worked to implement the ability to load private-bower on a \"siteBaseURL\", enabling the site to be moved to a sub directory.   This helps with hosting the site on a shared internal server or hosting behind a reverse proxy.\r\n\r\nFor the configuration file, I moved port and hostName options, under a group, called server.  This is where added the config for siteBaseURL.    This groups everything logically together.   I also ensured that, if people still had the port & hostName on the root, it would pick it up there, so that it would not break anyone's existing configuration.\r\n\r\nif the siteBaseURL is defined, private-bower will add one additional route, which is to redirect / to the specified URL.    So that people can still type in localhost:port when testing.\r\n\r\nAlso, fixed some inconsistencies with the 'default' heroku registry urls in the default config, and in the configurationManager.    Both are now the same, and use secure protocol.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",
